# Introduction

This project is client side code that will run on the Raspberry Pi. You need Python3 installed on your machine to run this.

## How To Run This

It is best to run this project using a virtual environment. To understand how Python virtual environments work, see [here](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/venv.html).

To create a virtual environment on your machine, do the following:

1. CD into the directory of your project

2. Run the following command: `python3 -m venv pi-rfid-virtual-env`. This will create a virtual environment called `pi-rfid-virtual-env` in your current directory.

3. Next, run the following command to activate the virtual environment: `source pi-rfid-virtual-env/bin/activate`.
